    <p>To maintain, expand and develop our business we need to record the personal data of prospective candidates and client contacts.</p>

    <h3>Consent</h3>

We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1).

      <li>analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site;</li>

      <li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
      <li>If PONTET Consulting Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
      <li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with our legal obligation, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of PONTET Consulting Limited, our customers, or others.

    </ul>

    <p>The lawful basis for the third-party processing will include:</p>

      <li>for the purpose of a contract in place or in contemplation;</li>
      <li>to fulfil their legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where we store and process your personal data</h3>

    <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (”EEA”). It may be transferred to third parties outside of the EEA for the purpose of our recruitment services. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, our recruitment services and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>

    <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

    <h3>Retention of your data</h3>

    <p>We understand our legal duty to retain accurate data and only retain personal data for as long as we need it for our legitimate business interests and that you are happy for us to do so. Accordingly, we have a data retention notice and run data routines to remove data that we no longer have a legitimate business interest in maintaining.</p>

    <p>We do the following to try to ensure our data is accurate:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>our website enables you to manage your data and to review whether the details we hold about you are accurate;</li>
      <li>prior to making an introduction we check that we have accurate information about you;</li>
      <li>we keep in touch with you so you can let us know of changes to your personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We segregate our data so that we keep different types of data for different time periods. The criteria we use to determine whether we should retain your personal data includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the nature of the personal data;</li>
      <li>its perceived accuracy;</li>
      <li>our legal obligations;</li>
      <li>whether an interview or placement has been arranged; and</li>
      <li>our recruitment expertise and knowledge of the industry by sector and job role.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may archive part or all of your personal data or retain it on our financial systems only, deleting all or part of it from our main Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) system. We may pseudonymise parts of your data, particularly following a request for suppression or deletion of your data, to ensure that we do not re-enter your personal data on to our database, unless requested to do so.</p>

    <p>For your information, Pseudonymised Data is created by taking identifying fields within a database and replacing them with artificial identifiers, or pseudonyms.</p>

    <p>Our current retention notice is available upon request.</p>

    <h3>Your rights</h3>

    <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes and we will collect express consent from you if legally required prior to using your personal data for marketing purposes.</p>

    <p>You can exercise your right to accept or prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:jt@pontet.com">jt@pontet.com</a></p>

    <p>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>

    <p>The GDPR provides you with the following rights. To:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
      <li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
      <li>Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
      <li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
      <li>Request the transfer of your personal information to another party in certain formats, if practicable.</li>
      <li>Make a complaint to a supervisory body which in the United Kingdom is the Information Commissioner’s Office. The ICO can be contacted through this link: <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/">https://ico.org.uk/concerns/</a></li>
    </ul>
